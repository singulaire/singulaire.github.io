      <description>About Me My name is Tom Blau and I&amp;rsquo;m a machine learning researcher interested in using reinforcement learning to do something more valuable than just generating papers. I completed my Ph.D. at the university of Sydney in 2020, completing a thesis on reinforcement learning for robotics. One of the most striking lessons from my Ph.D. was the gap between state-of-the-art RL and actual, real-world applications that provide benefit to flesh-and-blood humans.</description>

      <title>Notes on Notation</title>

      <description>This post is a living document of various ideas on mathematical notation that I think are interesting.
Tuple or Set? I often encounter the situation where I have a collection of mathematical objects whose ordering doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. The default is usually to pronounce such a collection to be a tuple, and it&amp;rsquo;s common to hear people colloquially refer to any collection as a (n-)tuple even if ordering is irrelevant. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re computing a Monte Carlo estimate of an expectation, you typically have a collection of samples and calculate their average, but how should you write this?</description>

      <title>Upper and Lower Mutual Information Bounds</title>
      <link>https://singulaire.github.io/post/upper-and-lower-mutual-information-bounds/</link>

      <description>Recently Foster et al (2020) introduced a couple of tractable bounds that can be used to estimate the expected information gain (EIG) of a design policy (a mapping from past designs and observations to the next design). These include the sequential Prior Contrastive Estimate (sPCE) lower bound:
$$ \mathcal{L}_T(\pi) = \mathbb{E} \left[ \log \frac{p(h_T | \theta_0, \pi)}{\frac{1}{L+1} \sum_0^L p(h_T | \theta_l, \pi)} \right] $$
where $h_T = (d_0, y_0,\dots,d_T,y_T)$ is the experimental history at time $T$, $\pi$ is the design policy, $L$ is the number of contrastiv samples and $\theta$ parameterises the experimental model $p(y|\theta, d)$ that maps designs to a distribution over outcomes.</description>
